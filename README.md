## Research Papers
- [Among Them: A game-based framework for assessing persuasion capabilities of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20426) - In this paper, we present an Among Us-inspired game framework for assessing LLM deception skills in a controlled environment. The proposed framework makes it possible to compare LLM models by game statistics, as well as quantify in-game manipulation according to 25 persuasion strategies from social psychology and rhetoric. (PAKDD 2025)

## Artificial Intelligence
